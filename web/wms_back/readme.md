Basic implementation of the wms.hgis.cartomatic.pl WMS service.
It is meant to act as an engine serving the public, unauthenticated users, therefore it always stamps a watermark over the returned raster data.

All the requests pass through the tilecache, so whenever a requested tile feets into the configured tile scheme, it is either returned from the cache, or 
generated by the wms engine, and cached for further usage.
